\chapter*{Abstract}
The economy is moving towards automation. Roads are an essential factor in growth, development, and providing services. Though documented extensively in papers, the detection of small roads in mid-resolution satellites is still a problem. The work here sheds light on combining the low-level computer vision problem of super-resolution with the high-level computer vision problem of road-detection. We investigate the behavior when we first enhancing the image resolution before directly apply road-detection. We try to identify the small roads from a mid-resolution satellite image, which are otherwise skipped by the model prediction by combining the two different levels of computer vision problems.

The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks supported by ResNet architecture. It also uses encoder-decoder and dilated convolutions to segment the image to identify roads and take the spatial context into account. The method described here allows us to improve the capability of any model to now detect finer roads.
