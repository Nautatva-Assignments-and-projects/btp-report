With so much to talk in this report, everything can be summarised into a small picure - Figure~\ref{fig:the_complete_picture}

\section{Pros}
The model predicted most of the roads which were predicted by the model without super-resolution. Apart from that, the model also predicted a lot of other small roads. On validating with the ground truth images, I found that this was actually a very good prediction. Figure~\ref{fig:run_merge_road_maps}

\section{Cons}
One of most noticable disadvantage of using this model is the amount of time required to get the predictions. 

Another disadvantage is too much affect due to inaccuracies in training dataset. In case the road gets too thick, like maybe we took a image with a little higher resolution, and run the model, we see that our model has several disconitnuiteis in between. This is mainly because of the noise which has effected the weights. this error can be reduced by training the model with more precise data. Another way to correct this error is to run the algorithm without super-resolution. This means we need to train the model a again, this time without super resolution.

% TODO: Add the image of without SR, use it as con on the thick road.


Now that we have 2 predictions, one with super-resolution and without it, we merge them. Because the resolution is different, we need to first make them of same resolutions. We do this by finding out the difference factors. Let's say if the difference factors is x on each side, we split the lower resolution image pixels into x different pixels in both sides. Then we average the resultant images of same resolution. For referece: look at Figure~\ref{fig:roads_in_confidence}
